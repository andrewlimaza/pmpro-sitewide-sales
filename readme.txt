Run a sitewide sales (Black Friday, Cyber Monday, etc.) with Paid Memberships Pro.

== Description ==

This plugin requires Paid Memberships Pro to function.

The Sitewide Sales Add On allows you to create flash or sitewide sales. A Sitewide Sale CPT allows you to create multiple sales, each with an associated discount code and landing page. The plugin will automatically apply a discount code for users who visit the sale landing page.

The plugin also adds the option to display sitewide page banners to advertise your sale and gives you statistics about the outcome of your sale.
